//  CDEEncryptedCloudFileSystem.h
//  Ensembles
//
//  This class is not a standard file system. It is used to wrap an existing
//  file system, and encrypt any files going into it.
//  It will decrypt files coming from the cloud as needed.
//  Files are encrypted using a symmetric AES key built upon some user provided
//  password.
//
//  This file system requires the Security framework, and RNCryptor.

 *  Once instanciated, the password and salt fields are unreachable, but the object responds as expected to the -isEqual: message.
