Changes in 3.1.0
----------------
**NOTE:** If you downloaded the 3.1.0 SDK on September 16 2014 before
approximately 6pm US/Pacific time you received a defective
version. Please download the SDK zipfile again. We apologize for this
issue.

This is a major release, with API changes which may require updates
to your application code.  See the "Potentially Breaking Changes" section below
for more information.

###New Features:
- __Datastore Sharing__:
  This release contains a new feature that lets users share their datastores with
  each other, under control of the app.
  You can find more details on this feature in the
  [documentation](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/datastore/docs/ios).
  Some specifics:
  - New enum DBDatastore.DBRole.
  - New NSString constants DBDatastore.DBPrincipalTeam, DBDatastore.DBPrincipalPublic.
  - New static method DBDatastoreManager.isValidShareableId.
  - New properties DBDatastore.isWritable, DBDatastore.isShareable, DBDatastore.effectiveRole.
  - New methods DBDatastore.getRoleForPrincipal, DBDatastore.setRoleForPrincipal,
    DBDatastore.deleteRoleForPrincipal, DBDatastore.listRoles.
  - New properties DBDatastoreInfo.role, DBDatastoreInfo.isShareable, DBDatastoreInfo.isWritable.
- __Local Datastores__:
  This release contains the final version of a new feature that allows you to create
  and use datastores locally on a device without linking a Dropbox account first.  When
  the user logs in and wishes to sync, you can then migrate their datastores to a
  Dropbox account.
  You can find more details on this feature in the
  [documentation](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/datastore/docs/ios).
  Changes to this feature since the 3.0 release:
  - New properties DBDatastoreManager.isLocal, DBDatastoreManager.account.
  - Fix a case where list inserts weren't properly merged when migrating a
    local datastore to an account.
  - Fix a case where repeatedly inserting and deleting a record into a
    local datastore would cause storage to grow indefinitely.
  - Other bug fixes.
- __Resuming Uploads__: Datastore changes which are not uploaded before shutdown,
  will now begin uploading automatically the next time a DBDatastoreManager or
  DBDatastore is created with the same account.
- __Platform Support__:
  Validated compatibility with Xcode 6 (beta 3+), iOS 8, and OS X 10.10.

###Potentially Breaking Changes:
- -[DBError code] no longer returns a different type from its superclass
  property, though the NSInteger value is still guaranteed to be one of
  the values defined by the DBErrorCode enum.  -[DBError dbErrorCode] is now
  available to access the error code as a DBErrorCode enum.

### Other Changes
- Fix a bug where attempting to modify a read-only shared folder would fail to
  upload and block the upload of other changes.  Such changes will now be blocked
  locally and return DBErrorReadOnly.  Making changes before the read-only
  state is received from the server will result in those changes being lost.
- Add DBDatastoreManager.sharedManager singleton, set with DBDatastoreManager.setSharedManager.
- New error codes DBErrorCancelled, DBErrorReadOnly, DBErrorRetryLater.
- Fix a case where a datastore is incorrectly marked as "connected" after
  communication ends.
- Fix a possible crash when mixing thumbnail and file downloads.

Changes in 3.0.2
----------------
- fix crashes and inconsistencies when an app was repeatedly restarted
  while being flooded with incoming changes

Changes in 3.0.1
----------------
- Fix an issue with incorrect DBDatastoreInfo properties (title/mtime) after
  migration of local datastores.
- properly shut down DBDatastoreManager when its account is unlinked.
- OS X: fix error in cache migration due to attempt to move .DS_Store file

Changes in 3.0.0
----------------

This is a major release, with API changes which may require updates
to your application code.  See the "Potentially Breaking Changes" section below
for more information.

###New Features (Files):

- __Configurable Cache Size__:
  You can now set the maximum size of cached file contents to store locally.  Beyond
  that size, files are removed in LRU order, so long as they are no longer in use.
  You can use a cache size of 0 to disable caching of files which are not in use.
  Files which are in use (open or uploading) are never deleted, and may cause
  the cache to be temporarily larger than the configured size.
- __Batching of Operations__:
  Multiple operations manipulating the filesystem (such as moves or deletes) can be
  automatically batched to be upload together for faster syncing.  File content changes
  are still processed individually.
- __Expanded Sync Status__:
  DBSyncStatus is now an interface type which includes fields indicating errors in
  background syncing.

###New Features (Datastores):

- __App-Selected Datastore IDs__:
  You can now use [DBDatastoreManager openOrCreateDatastore:error:] to create datastores
  with local IDs like "settings".  The default datastore is no longer a special case, but
  simply a datastore with the ID "default".
  ___Backward Compatibility Note: Older SDK versions can open datastores with local IDs.
  However there is a known issue if the ID of one datastore is a prefix of the ID
  of another one (e.g. note1 and note11).  In such a situation, when "note1" is
  deleted, the old SDK will also delete the local cache for "note11".  You should
  avoid assigning IDs in this way if you need to interoperate with old SDK versions.___
- __Expanded Datastore Info__:
  DbxDatastoreInfo now includes fields for title and mtime (last modification time).
  Title can be set using -[DBDatastore setTitle:], while mtime is set automatically
  (using the local clock) each time you call -[DBDatastore sync:] with outgoing changes.
- __Expanded Datastore Status__:
  DBDatastoreStatus is now an interface type which includes fields indicating errors in
  background syncing, as well as a new status flag which indicates when a datastore is
  unable to sync.
- __Datastore Size Accessors__:
  There are new accessors to allow you to check the size of your data and avoid the
  syncing limits.
- __Datastore Cache Management__:
  You can use -[DBDatastoreManager uncacheDatastore:error:] to remove a datastore from the
  cache, in order to save space, or reset it from an unsyncable state.
- __[Preview Feature] Local Datastores__:
  This release contains a preview of a new feature that allows you to create and
  use datastores locally on a device without linking a Dropbox account first.  When
  the user logs in and wishes to sync, you can then migrate their datastores to a
  Dropbox account.
  ___This feature is not ready for production use, and shouldn't be used in production
  apps.___
  You can find more details on this feature in the
  [documentation](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/datastore/docs/android).

###Potentially Breaking Changes:

- DBSyncStatus and DBDatastoreStatus are now interface types.  The flags previously
  available in the bitfield are now available as BOOL properties.
- The set of DBError codes has changed.  You may need to adjust your error checking
  code to use the new enum values.
- Some failure cases (such as illegal arguments, or use of a closed file) now raise
  DBException rather than returning DBError (or silently failing in some cases).
  See the comments in DBError for the list of error codes which typically cause
  exceptions.

### Other Changes

- Now allows longer IDs to be used for datastores, tables, records, and fields.
- Fixed bug causing datastores created offline to be lost if not synced before
  restart.
- Relocate temp files to be within the primary SyncAPI cache directory.
  this fixes a failure on OS X with cache and temp dir on different devices
- OS X: Add missing AppKit import in DBAccountManager.h
- OS X: Use @loader_path rather than @executable_path for install directory,
  and build with -headerpad_max_install_names to allow apps to change
  dependant paths using install_name_tool.
- Fixed bugs in edge-cases of datastore syncing and conflict resolution.
- Many general performance and stability improvements.

Changes in 2.1.2
----------------
- fix bug where deleting a datastore with ID dsid deletes other datastores
  whose IDs have dsid as a prefix
- fix bug where a stale file version is opened after a file is
  renamed, then written while still open

Changes in 2.1.1
----------------
- fix HTTP errors on iOS 5.0 and OS X 10.7
- avoid extra network requests on unlinked accounts
- add -[DBFilesystem shutDown] to explicitly stop all syncing
- make all sample apps compile warning-free in Xcode 5.1

Changes in 2.1.0
----------------
- first SDK release for OS X, sharing the same Objective-C interface with iOS
- enforce strict security settings on SSL communication
- enable HTTP connection reuse
- change symbols to avoid conflicts with other uses of sqlite3 library
- fix bug where datastore cache wasn't being deleted on unlink
- The following classes now all provide custom isEqual:/hash/copyWithZone:
  methods for use in NSDictionary/NSSet, plus description methods for
  debugging: DBAccount, DBAccountInfo, DBFileInfo, DBFileStatus, DBPath,
  DBRecord, DBTable, DBList.
  Note: The identity information which defines comparison for these objects
  is always immutable.  For classes which aren't Info/Status, comparison is
  based on what they are, not what they contain.  E.g. isEqual: compares the
  ID of a datastore record (not its fields) and the auth token of an account
  (not its cached data).  Descriptions are not guaranteed to be complete,
  unique, or unchanged in future versions.
- improvements to error reporting

Changes in 2.0.3
