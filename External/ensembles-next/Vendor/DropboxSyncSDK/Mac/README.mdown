Dropbox API SDK for OS X
========================

This package contains the OS X SDK for the
[Dropbox Sync API](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/sync) and 
[Dropbox Datastore API](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/datastore).

Installing
----------

The Sync and Datastore APIs are both available as part of a single
framework.  Installation instructions for Dropbox.framework can be
found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/datastore/sdks/ios).

This framwork can be used on Mac OS X 10.7 or higher in 64-bit apps.
You can build your application using Xcode 5 or higher.

Getting Started
---------------

To learn how to build your first app using the Datastore API, follow the
Datastore [tutorial](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/datastore/tutorial/osx).

There is also a [Sync API tutorial](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/sync/tutorial/osx)
to show you how to read and write files from Dropbox.

Examples
--------

There are two Xcode projects in the Examples directory with examples of how to
use the Datastore and File Sync API. All examples require Xcode 5.0+ and OS X 10.7+
(10.8+ for ImageBrowser).

### Examples/Files Examples OSX.xcodeproj: ###

   link an account, list a folder, and read/write a file.  
2. ImageBrowser - A Finder-like app for image preview that demonstrates how to
