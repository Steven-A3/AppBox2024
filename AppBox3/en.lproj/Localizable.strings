"SECURITY_INFO" = "Apple uses a technology called Data Protection. It encrypts your data with secure 256-bit key and hardware AES Engine. By setting up a device passcode, you automatically enables Data Protection.\nThe passcode is \"tangled\" with the device's UID, so brute-force attempts must be performed on the device under attack. A large iteration count is used to make each attempt slower. The iteration count is calibrated so that one attempt takes approximately 80 milliseconds. This means it would take more than 5½ years to try all combinations of a six-character alphanumeric passcode with lowercase letters and numbers, or 2½ years for a nine-digit passcode with numbers only.";
